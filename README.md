Number guessing game in C++
It's a simple game. Goal is to guess a number. Length of number is given from the user, and number of guesses depends on the length.
If the length is less than 10, then number of user chances will be equal to length. 
Otherwise, user have 10 chances to guess the number.
Main functionality of code is based on working with strings, so we used <string> library.
Prototype of main game functions included at the top of the code for better code readability.
WARNING: Code may not be compatible with old C++ compilers, such as GCC v5 or older.
Also, you need to use C++11 or newer versions.
